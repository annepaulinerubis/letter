            <h2>Dear C,
<br>
<br>
                Haler, ang random nito, think of this as an appreciation letter HAHAHAHAHA. 
                
                I really really appreciate you listening to my endless problems in life, 
                
                and somehow it really helped me to feel at ease and find my peace. 
                
                It is such a blessing that i met you, i'm comfortable opening up 
                
                my unsaid thoughts and struggles with you. Your words always gets me, 
                
                you always say the exact words that i wanted to hear. At first, 
                
                I felt like opening my problems to you is okay  because you're a stranger, 
                
                but now i'm really comfortable to telling you about it because it's you. 
                
                I admire you for a lot of things. I really, really appreciate your 
                
                existence not because natatakbuhan kita kapag may problems ako but 
                
                because i know that you are also struggling with your own issues but 
                
                you have a very kind and pure heart to listen to other people's struggles. 
                
                You are strong enough to continue living your life and even helping other 
                
                people despite the challenges that life has thrown at you. You are passionate 
                
                sa ginagawa mo and i think that alone is enough to admire what kind of 
                
                a person you are. I hope you continue to fight until you reach your goal. 
                
                I'm sure your parents are so so proud of you because you grew up as a person 
                
                who is full of hope that you can share with other people. They raised such a 
                
                wonderful man who is kind hearted and it shows in everything he does. 
                
                That's how i see you as a person, even though you may not have noticed it 
                
                but yeah keep fighting:) i'm sure you'll save many lives in the future<3
                <br>
                <br>
                Sincerely, A</h2>
